Say what I say, any way, I might be saying it
Give me that old time religion
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
And belie quiet liars as I
אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
What myths must make us man?
You could never know!
What's up party people?
You could never know!
Give me that old time religion
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
Like you knew anything, never ever
Give me that old time religion
What we are not
But I've been wrong before
That I am the "me"
My Lord, I know enough to get my facts right
You could never know!
And everything and everyone will die soon
Or anyone else
It's not profound to know that you could never know!Yes or no isn't null
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
What we are is
And that's good enough for me
It's not profound to know that you could you could
Yes it is, no, I don't know
And that's good enough for me
The void within the form
And we built these walls strong
We've always all been wrong
And what's the source of you?
That I'm trying while my eyes do defy
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You could never know!
No matter what we seek you'll never find truth
So give me that old time religion
And yet you believe it's true
It's good enough but not enough
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You should know better than that by now
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
Don't you forget
Why I'm not whatever, what the fuck 'cause
I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight
So give me that old time religion
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
Yes or no, isn't that a silly question?
Is just to protect you from
I'm hoping that this one might be my past life
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
In your head, in your head, in your head
It's not profound to know that you could you could
And we'll have nothing left for us to lie to
To be good enough for me
Give me that old time religion
It's not profound to know that you could you could
What? What I wonder?
Trust in yourself
You could never know!
What is "what?"
That all you project
You should know better than that by now
You could never know!
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
Even I might defy, won't deny
That I was born into
You should know better than that by now
Well, you do
What is "is, " what is "not?"
It's good enough for me
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
Ask it anyway, 'cause
You should know better than that by now
Why, I can't see
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
