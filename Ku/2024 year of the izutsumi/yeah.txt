Why, I can't see
That I am the "me"
That I was born into
And what's the source of you?
In your head, in your head, in your head
And yet you believe it's true
Well, you do
Like you knew anything, never ever
Trust in yourself
Or anyone else
We've always all been wrong
And we built these walls strong
Even I might defy, won't deny
That I'm trying while my eyes do defy
And belie quiet liars as I
Say what I say, any way, I might be saying it
But I've been wrong before
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
Don't you forget
That all you project
Is just to protect you from
The void within the form
Yes or no isn't null
Yes it is, no, I don't know
Yes or no, isn't that a silly question?
Ask it anyway, 'cause
What we are is
What we are not
אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה
What myths must make us man?
What is "is, " what is "not?"
What is "what?"
What's up party people?
What? What I wonder?
Why I'm not whatever, what the fuck 'cause
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight
I'm hoping that this one might be my past life
My Lord, I know enough to get my facts right
And that's good enough for me
And everything and everyone will die soon
And we'll have nothing left for us to lie to
No matter what we seek you'll never find truth
And that's good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It's good enough but not enough
To be good enough for me
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
