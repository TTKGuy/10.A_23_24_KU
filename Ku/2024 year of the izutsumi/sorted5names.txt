And belie quiet liars as I
And everything and everyone will die soon
And that's good enough for me
And that's good enough for me
And we built these walls strong
And we'll have nothing left for us to lie to
And what's the source of you?
And yet you believe it's true
Ask it anyway, 'cause
But I've been wrong before
Don't you forget
Even I might defy, won't deny
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight
I'm hoping that this one might be my past life
In your head, in your head, in your head
Is just to protect you from
It's good enough but not enough
It's good enough for me
It's not profound to know that you could never know!It's not profound to know that you could never know!
It's not profound to know that you could never know!
It's not profound to know that you could you could
It's not profound to know that you could you could
It's not profound to know that you could you could
Like you knew anything, never ever
My Lord, I know enough to get my facts right
No matter what we seek you'll never find truth
Or anyone else
Say what I say, any way, I might be saying it
So give me that old time religion
So give me that old time religion
That I am the "me"
That I was born into
That I'm trying while my eyes do defy
That all you project
The void within the form
To be good enough for me
Trust in yourself
We've always all been wrong
Well, you do
What is "is, " what is "not?"
What is "what?"
What myths must make us man?
What we are is
What we are not
What's up party people?
What? What I wonder?
Why I'm not whatever, what the fuck 'cause
Why, I can't see
Yes it is, no, I don't know
Yes or no isn't null
Yes or no, isn't that a silly question?
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You could never know!
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
You should know better than that by now
